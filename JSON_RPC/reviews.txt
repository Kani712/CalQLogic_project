Another great product from Paul Mitchell. This Tea Tree shampoo really does a great job of cleaning all the impurities from your hair. If you use alot of products, hairspray, serum, mousse it tends to build up after awhile. This shampoo is made to clean all impurites from your hair while leaving it really soft and feeling great. The smell of this is really strong a minty smell. I have really long, fine and limp hair and this shampoo doesn't weigh it down at all. You only have to use this shampoo once or twice a week depending on the condition of your hair. Since I began using it I have really noticed a difference in my hair it seems more managable
